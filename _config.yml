author: Revpol
description: Real world manipulation refers to the subtle and often invisible ways in which individuals, organizations, or even governments influence the behaviors, beliefs, and decisions of others. It can take various forms, from psychological tactics and social engineering to media control and political maneuvering. While some forms of manipulation are ethical, others cross moral boundaries, leading to exploitation and control. In todayâ€™s interconnected world, understanding the mechanisms of manipulation is crucial for individuals to make informed choices and preserve autonomy in their daily lives.
